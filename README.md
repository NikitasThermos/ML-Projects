Made for 'Machine Learning' university course

# Project 1 - Fetal Health
This project works with tabular data generated by cardiotography on pregnant women and contains fetal infromation. The dataset can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/193/cardiotocography). The goal of the project was to procees these information and create a model that is able to predict the fetal state (Normal, Suspect and Pathologic)

# Project 2 - Colorectal Cancer
In this project we use an image dataset of hematoxylin-eosin-stained tissue slides that can be used for colorectal cancer prognosis. The dataset was created by [this paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30677016/). Goal of the project was to create CNN models that can process the images and classify it as one of the possible 9 classes.
